# INTRODUCTION 

Crops grown in West Bengal, such as rice, potato, and tea are vital agricultural crops that play significant roles in global food security and economies. Rice (Oryza Sativa L.), a staple for over half of the worldâ€™s population, particularly in Asia, covers approximately 100 million hectares globally. In Indonesia alone, nearly 150 kilograms per person were consumed annually in 2017, reflecting its critical importance. Similarly, potatoes (Solanum tuberosum) are a major food source worldwide, known for their versatility and nutritional value. Tea (Camellia sinensis), cultivated primarily in Asia and Africa, is a globally consumed beverage that also holds economic importance for several developing countries. The cultivation of these crops faces numerous challenges, particularly from diseases that can significantly reduce yields and quality, underscoring the need for effective disease management strategies.

# Purpose 
	
The purpose of this research is to develop and implement a comprehensive, web-based system for detecting diseases in rice, potato, and tea plants using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with the GoogLeNet architecture. This system will employ advanced image processing methods to accurately identify and classify plant diseases from visual symptoms captured in photographs. By providing a user-friendly interface accessible via the internet, this system aims to equip farmers with a powerful tool for real-time disease monitoring and management.
The primary objective is to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of disease detection, enabling timely and effective interventions. This will help mitigate the adverse effects of diseases on crop yields and quality, ultimately supporting food security and economic stability. The system is designed to be accessible to farmers, including those with limited technical expertise, thereby democratizing access to advanced agricultural technology. In addition to disease detection, the system will offer educational resources and actionable insights, empowering farmers with the knowledge to implement appropriate disease management strategies. Through this research, we aim to contribute to sustainable agricultural practices, improve the resilience of farming communities, and ensure the continued productivity of these essential crops.
